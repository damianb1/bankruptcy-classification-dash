# bankruptcy-classification-dash


This is an analytic web app created with Python and Dash framework. 
It allows you to perform a machine learning experiment. 
The goal is to create a bankruptcy prediction model using historical data.
You can test various methods and algorithms for tasks such as model fitting, data preprocessing, model selection and evaluation, visualization, etc.
Most of the features were made with tools provided by scikit-learn and pandas libraries.

To test the application, you can run it locally. For instructions, check running_the_app.md file.

(The app is not meant for conducting real analysis. It merely demonstrates some functionalities of dash framework in an example context.)
